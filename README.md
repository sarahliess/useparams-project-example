# A simple blog using react hooks

I created a simple example blog with some mock data from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), to show explain the following concepts to our students: 

- useState
- useEffect
- useParams
- axios

The blog is deployed [here](https://sarahliess.github.io/useparams-project-example). For live-coding & collaboration purposes it can also be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/useparams-useeffect-usestate-tcfzg?file=/src/App.js:423-460).
